            <h3 class="title">Here’s Everything You Need To Prepare To Travel The World</h3>
            <p class="text">Decide Where You Want to Go-<br><br>
                The first step in preparing for your trip is, of course, deciding where you want to go. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s actually an important decision. After all, there’s a big world out there and you need to narrow down your options. So ask yourself: what kind of experience are you looking for? Do you want to explore a new culture? See natural wonders? Or just relax on a beach somewhere? Once you have a general idea of the kind of trip you want to take, you can start narrowing down your options.<br><br>
                Store Your Belongings<br> <br>
                If you’re planning on being gone for an extended period of time, you’ll need to figure out what to do with your belongings. If you’re worried about leaving your stuff in your apartment, you can always ask a friend or family member to housesit. Or, if you’re planning on subletting your place, you can leave your belongings there. But if neither of those options is possible or desirable, then you’ll need to find a storage solution. You can find a facility at Storefriendly Paya Lebar that will fit your needs and budget. On the other hand, if you’re really set on hitting the road, you could sell everything you own and travel with just a backpack. It’s up to you!<br><br>
                Book a Flight <br> <br>
                Now that you know where you’re going, it’s time to book your flight. This can be a tricky process, especially if you’re trying to stick to a budget. The best way to find a good deal is to be flexible with your travel dates and start looking for flights several months in advance. You can also use sites like Skyscanner or Momondo to compare prices and find the best deal. Keep in mind that you should always clear your cookies before searching for flights, as airlines will often raise prices if they see that you’ve been looking at their site multiple times.
                Here’s Everything You Need to Prepare to Travel the WorldHere’s Everything You Need to Prepare to Travel the World
                Here’s Everything You Need to Prepare to Travel the World <br> <br>
                Book Accommodation <br> <br>
                After you’ve booked your flight, it’s time to start thinking about where you’re going to stay. If you’re on a tight budget, then hostels are definitely the way to go. They’re usually pretty cheap and you’ll get to meet other travelers from all over the world. But if you’re looking for a little more comfort, then you can always book a room in a hotel or an Airbnb. Just make sure to read the reviews carefully before booking anything!<br> <br>
                Make a Plan <br> <br>
                Now that you’ve got your flights and accommodation sorted, it’s time to start making a plan for your trip. This is where you’ll decide what you want to see and do in each place you visit. There are plenty of resources out there to help you plan your trip, including travel guides, blog posts, and even YouTube videos. And if you’re feeling really lost, you can always reach out to a travel agent for help.<br> <br>
                Set a Budget<br> <br>
                No matter how long you’re planning on being gone, it’s important to set a budget for your trip. This will help you save money and avoid getting into debt. There are a few different ways to approach budgeting for your trip. You can either create a daily or monthly budget, or you can save up a certain amount of money before you go. Whichever method you choose, make sure to be realistic about your spending and give yourself a buffer for unexpected expenses.<br> <br>
                Pack Your Stuff <br> <br>
                Now it’s time to start packing! This can be a daunting task, but it’s important to remember that you don’t need to bring everything with you. Just pack the essentials and leave the rest at home. And if you’re really struggling to figure out what to bring, there are plenty of packing lists online that can help you out.<br> <br>
                Have Fun <br> <br>
                Finally, it’s time to have some fun! Whether you’re traveling solo or with friends, make sure to take some time to enjoy yourself. Explore new places, try new things, and just relax. After all, that’s what vacations are for!
                So there you have it! Everything you need to prepare for your trip around the world. Just remember to take your time, do your research, and most importantly, have fun! Safe travels!</p>

            <h3 class="title">Incredible India</h3>
            <p class="text">One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.

                Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes, history and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveller can get the best of both worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through the golden Thar, India has options galore for all.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Adventure Sports</h3>
            <p class="text">Apart from its breathtakingly beautiful landscapes, Interlaken is also a paradise for all adventure sports enthusiasts. In fact, the list of these thrill-inducing activities is quite unending when it comes to this resort town and is therefore the top Swiss destination for adventure sports. Get your adrenaline pumping as you bungee jump into the unknown. Experience your heart racing with excitement as you go sky diving above the massive mountains. Let bliss wash over you as you enjoy a bird’s eye view of emerald lakes and verdant pastures, all while paragliding with your ever-so-protective guide. You could embark on a trek across some of the longest glaciers in Europe and cycle along meadows and hills that are perpetually alive with the sound of music. Nothing will stop you from channelling your inner Tiger Woods with a nice session of golf and once you’re done, you can explore the charming streets of the town on a Segway! And if you still haven’t had enough, Interlaken also has a kart track of its own for you to go wild.
            </p>
            <p class="text">Do keep in mind that these activities require prior reservations. Expect to spend anything around 500 CHF per person, depending on the sport. The memories you will go back home with are worth all the money.</p>
